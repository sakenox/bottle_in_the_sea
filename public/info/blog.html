            <h2>How SeaNotes Was Born</h2>
            <p>SeaNotes started as a passion project to connect people in an anonymous yet meaningful way. Learn more about our journey and the inspiration behind the platform.</p>
            <p>Our founder, Jane Doe, was inspired by the idea of a message in a bottle during a beach walk. The thought of sending a message out into the world, without knowing who might find it, sparked the creation of SeaNotes. We wanted to combine the mystery of the ocean with the power of words, and thus, SeaNotes was born.</p>
